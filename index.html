        <h1>Ketogenic diet</h1>
        <p>
            When your body is in ketosis, it switches from using carbohydrates as fuel to using fat as fuel.

It happens when you drastically cut back on carbohydrates, which restricts your body's ability to produce glucose (sugar), the primary source of energy for cells.


The best strategy to start ketosis is to follow a ketogenic diet. Typically, this entails restricting daily carbohydrate intake to 20 to 50 grams and consuming more fats from foods like meat, fish, eggs, nuts, and healthy oils (6Trusted Source).

It's also crucial to limit your protein intake. This is because excessive protein consumption can result in the conversion of protein into glucose, which could delay the onset of ketosis (10Trusted Source).

Intermittent fasting is a technique that may assist you in achieving ketosis.
