        The Mediterranean diet is based on foods that have historically been consumed in places like Italy and Greece. It is abundant in


fruits and veggies, whole grains
lentils, salmon, almonds, and olive oil
Red meat consumption should be restricted, while foods like chicken, eggs, and dairy products should be consumed in moderation.

The Mediterranean diet also restricts:

refined foods
trans fat
added sugar, processed meats, and other highly processed foods
This diet's focus on minimally processed foods and plants has been linked to a lower risk of developing a number of chronic diseases as well as a longer life span. Additionally, studies demonstrate that the Mediterranean diet prevents several malignancies (1Trusted Source).

Numerous studies show that the diet's plant-based, high unsaturated fat nutritional pattern can help with weight loss, despite the fact that it was created to reduce the risk of heart disease (2).

After a year, the Mediterranean diet produced greater weight loss than a low-fat diet, according to a systematic review that looked at five distinct research. It had similar weight reduction effects as a low carb diet (3Trusted Source).

Higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet was discovered in one study of more than 500 adults over a 12-month period.
This diet's focus on unprocessed foods and vegetables has been linked to a decreased risk of several chronic diseases and a longer life span. Additionally, research indicates that the Mediterranean diet can help prevent several types of cancer (1Trusted Source).

Numerous studies show that the diet's high unsaturated fat, plant-based eating style can help with weight loss even though it was created to reduce the risk of heart disease (2).

In comparison to a low fat diet, the Mediterranean diet led to more weight loss after a year, according to a systematic analysis that looked at five independent research. It had comparable weight reduction outcomes to a low-carb diet (3Trusted Source).

Higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet over a 12-month period was discovered in one research of more than 500 adults.
